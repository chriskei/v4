My tennis buddy Andrew and I just signed up for a tennis social that meets every Wednesday, so I'm so hyped to play lots of great tennis this year!"

At the start of my freshman year at Northeastern, our recreational climbing club hosted a few free climbing nights, and after having a ton of fun at those, I was hooked. I started telling all my friends about climbing and built up a large group of us who would go three to four times a week, sometimes staying at Rock Spot until midnight. We got pretty good pretty fast, maxing out at a V6 in a year, but once Covid hit I decided to take a break. Back in August 2022 I started climbing again, but recently I injured the A2 pulley in my right ring finger so I'm taking it easy for a bit."

I always tell my parents, <When I have 8 million in savings, I'm going to open my own restaurant!>. I truly hope that that becomes reality one day as I'd love to share my food and culture with others."

Unlike tennis though, practicing for my piano lessons and recitals felt like a chore, so at the start of high school, I quit. A few years ago, as I was back at home for winter break, I randomly had the urge to play the piano again and I realized that I liked to play when it was an impromptu activity rather than something forced upon me. Nowadays, I will literally sightread anything and play any piece with an intriguing title on Musescore. I also arranged two pieces that I'll provide downloads to later!"
